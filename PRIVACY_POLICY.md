Slate is a global service with users, servers, and operations in multiple countries. Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country, and in some cases, may not be as protective.

We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy when transferred internationally, including:
- Entering into Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission with the recipients of your personal information
- Ensuring recipients of your information are subject to agreements requiring them to process information in accordance with applicable data protection laws

By using our Service, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information outside of your country of residence.

## 7. DATA RETENTION

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
- The duration of your relationship with us and the time needed to provide you with the Service
- Whether we have a legal obligation to retain the information (e.g., certain laws require us to keep records for a specified period)
- Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (e.g., in connection with statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations)

When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or anonymize it so that it can no longer be associated with you.

While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
